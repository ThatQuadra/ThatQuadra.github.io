            <h1><em>Planet Unknown</em> and Innovation:</h1>
              <p>The short film <em>Planet Unknown</em> (2016) is significant to this anthology of innovation and technology in several ways. It’s a groundbreaking work of CGI animated by one person, a student at the Communication University of China, Shawn Wang. It’s highly impressive what they were able to do using standard software. This was not a fast nor easy thing to produce, taking over 11 months, but it shows increasing democratization of animation where many more people are able to create a piece of media such as this. Commercially available programs like Cinema 4D (what was used to make the film) are advancing and CGI is becoming much more accessible. What was once reserved for large companies and studios is now usable by the general public.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The film itself also contains themes of technology and innovation. The overarching plot revolves around two rovers who are searching for a suitable place on another planet to plant a seed, but run into issues when meteors start falling from the sky. The rovers need to problem solve and work together to eventually plant the seed. The film doesn’t contain any dialogue, but the plot is clearly about making new worlds livable. This is supported by the film’s website where it’s stated that, “At the end of 21st century, mankind was facing global resource depletion. Space Rovers were sent out to find potential inhabitable planets”.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>Planet Unknown</em> includes cultural and historical significance as well. Developing and formerly developing nations like China are looking to the stars and innovating and exploring in ways that were formerly dominated by western countries. Change is happening in this frontier and the optimism of the film is reflective of that. It doesn’t place any focus on things that have gone wrong in hindsight, unlike a film like <em>WALL-E</em> (which shares many plot elements). This absence of a backstory was a little unexpected for me and I do want to know what happened on Earth. But that’s not what the film is about. It’s a story of how problems can be solved through invention. The rovers and their mission seek to fix past mistakes, not dwell on them, and as such the film has a fairly bright and inspirational outlook on the future. For example, the ending shot has the two rovers looking out on a landscape with the sun shining. The film revolves around innovation and discovery, which leads it to find a place in this anthology. Despite the lack of dialogue, the characters are expressive, the animation is crisp and the sound design is excellent, all of which allow it to communicate its themes effectively.&nbsp;</p>
