              <p>Liu Cixin (1963-) is a Chinese science fiction author. He is the most popular Chinese science fiction author in China. Formerly a computer systems engineer, he started writing in the 90s. His works have been published and recognized worldwide. He has gotten praise for the ambition and scale of his writing. Those publications also have been subject to criticism, especially from American politicians about his semi-positive opinions and portrayals of the Chinese government. He cites Orwell and Clarke as major influences to his work. By far, his most famous writing is the trilogy, <em>Remembrance of Earth's Past.</em>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Liu Cixin was born in 1963 in Beijing. He grew up in the midst of the Chinese cultural revolution. His parents were put to work in mines during that time. He moved to Yangquan, in the Henan province, and later went to university to study computer engineering. He worked at a power plant for a time, and eventually quit to become a writer. His writing reflects this education, often involving computers and other related technologies. From <em>The Three Body Problem</em>, "Battles like this one raged across Beijing like a multitude of CPUs working in parallel". His real-world knowledge augments his ability to write more detailed and plausible fiction.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>He has also been an advocate for the inclusion of Chinese works of writing into the global narrative. He has said that he want's to bridge ideological divides between China and western nations, by sharing writing and storytelling. He addresses aspects of Chinese identity in his works. He does this in several different ways, including taking place during pivotal moment's in the country's history (for example, the beginning of <em>The Three Body Problem</em> involves the cultural revolution), mentioning traditions, and generally being a product of the culture and values of the nation. His short fiction, <em>Mountain</em>, involves references to specific areas, geography and culture of the Tibetan/Himalayan region.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>This is not to say that his writing can't be universally appreciated. Like many writers, the human experience is a major topic in his works. Love and loss, risk and reward, all things that go beyond specific borders and regions. His short story, <em>Ball Lightning</em>, revolves around the tragic death of the main character's parents and them coping with that loss. Even if he might not live in the same region of the world as a reader, they can still get meaning and understanding from his works.&nbsp;</p>
