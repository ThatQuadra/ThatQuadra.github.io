            <h1>The Failure of a Single Goal in <em>The Grand Experiment</em>:</h1>
            <p><em>The Grand Experiment</em> by Mexican author Alberto Chimal discusses a future society that has a singular goal. This is to complete the "Grand Experiment". This leads the governments to become increasingly authoritarian and disregard other issues they are facing. They restrict speech, put immigrants in internment camps, and eventually push out native populations with their advanced weaponry. The story is written as a general log from an ambiguous narrator, of the events that happened, and interestingly, it doesn’t contain any individual characters. <em>The Grand Experiment</em> shows how a singular goal can blind a society. It conveys this theme through its monotonous tone, authoritarian setting, and the repetition of the societies' goal of completing the "Grand Experiment.”&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The story has a very rigid cadence, which shows how focused the discussed society is. Early in the story, after describing how immigration increased and was very controversial, the narrator says, "Later, summary executions began at the borders, on the coasts, and (in some cases) at internment camps and reeducation camps that were established within those countries.” This passage deals with how those immigrants were treated. The story maintains a flat tone, even while describing atrocities like this. This tone conveys the idea that these events have been normalized, or at least outrage is not permitted. The society does not care that these things are happening, and because of this, the narrator doesn't change their tone. Later, after many more crimes were committed, the story reads, "The Grand Experiment was simply the objective of the existing political and economic systems during that period of the world, and of their predecessors.” The tone of the story, as demonstrated by this passage, shows how the Grand Experiment is indisputable. The passage uses, "Was simply,” showing a statement of fact, and a way of taking it at face value. This is similar to how it is in the society. The pursuit of the Grand Experiment, and what that means, are to be taken as fact and not disputed.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The tone of the story shows how this singular goal is required to be taken as fact and how atrocities in its name are overlooked. This theme is also shown by the policies put in place by the society’s leadership. By suppressing citizens’ rights, such as free speech, the authoritarian governments try to continue with the “Grand Experiment” and they end up ignoring the other issues around them. As tensions rose, the narrator says, “Together with social control, disinformation campaigns were effective in diverting attention from the real reasons that products grew expensive and services deteriorated.” This shows how, because the government doesn’t want to admit its mistakes, it uses authoritarian methods to control and distract the population. As problems arise, such as rapid climate change and deteriorating living conditions, the governments try to divert the citizens’ attention away from them, taking away the opportunity to realize what’s wrong and question their leadership. Later in the story, these issues continue to grow and eventually lead to the near demise of the society. Because they refused to let discourse happen, afraid of changing their ways, other issues were not addressed and people suffered because of it. This is why the story’s authoritarian setting accentuates the problems of a singular goal.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Finally, the repetition of the idea of the “Grand Experiment” puts the reader in a similar position to the people in it. The phrase is repeated over and over again, in a way where you never know what it truly is. This ambiguity shows the danger of following one concept, especially a poorly defined one. You never know what it means, yet it is told to you that it must be followed without question. Sentences like, “Everything was part of the Grand Experiment.” It tells the reader that everything is happening for this reason and they aren’t allowed to challenge it. The forcefulness of the phrase emphasizes the unquestioning attitude of the society in the story. It makes the reader feel like they cannot question the reasoning, but they still feel that it’s wrong. Because of this, the repetition in the story puts readers in a position similar to that of those in it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>The Grand Experiment</em> by Alberto Chimal is a cautionary story and its society blindly follows the goal of completing the “Grand Experiment”. This is a dangerous path, that leads to many problems arising, both by people and nature. The governments try to put these fears to rest, without addressing any of the issues themselves and end up killing and displacing many people. It’s a dark future, yet still, a possible one. <em>The Grand Experiment</em> gets its point across by putting you in its world through tone, setting, and repetition. The story also brings up how technology can oppress populations. Advanced weaponry is used to eliminate the people living in territories that world governments wanted to occupy. It was also used to surveil and find dissidents. This is why another theme of the story is that technology, especially when significantly advanced, causes power imbalances that lead to oppression. The world governments would not have been able to inflict as much harm to native peoples and subjugate their citizens to the same degree if they had more rudimentary devices and technology. </p>
