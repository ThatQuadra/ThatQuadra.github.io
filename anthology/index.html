            <h1>Preface</h1>
              <p>This anthology is a collection of works pertaining to the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal9">UN Sustainable Development Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure)</a>. A variety of media forms were selected and the included pieces come from across the world. This was a key point in this anthology as well. There aren't any works from western sources as they are often overrepresented. Global fiction presents differing opinions and perspectives on worldwide issues. This anthology proved that technological developments can have many impacts, both positive and negative. They often represent the idea that the impact of technologies is highly dependent on how they are used.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Literature around the world has shown the positive aspects of innovations. For example, in <em><a href="/anthology/planet.html">Unknown Planet</a></em>, the advanced rovers are presented in a positive light. They are portrayed as saving humanity by  seeking out habitable planets. The film focuses on the rovers and they are portrayed as protagonists. In <em><a href="/anthology/Progandretro.html">Progress and Retrogression</a></em> the flyglass is initially presented as positive. There is, "Enormous happiness on the part of the fly.". This is presented as a good invention that brings joy to the flies. These stories show how innovations can be positive and mutually beneficial. There is an acknowledgement of the good that innovations can bring.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The reverse is presented as well. Technology is painted in a negative light and corruption of something positive is a recurring theme. In <em><a href="/anthology/Progandretro.html">Progress and Retrogression</a></em>, the flyglass is subverted and used to trap the flies that had initially loved it. There is another example of this is in the film, <em><a href="uncval.html">Uncanny Valley</a></em>. The VR simulation was revealed to be a way of remotely controlling androids and wage war against vulnerable people. The innovation which could have been used to remotely help others, instead was used to harm them. In <em><a href="grandexperiment.html">The Grand Experiment</a></em>, populations are targeted in the name of progress. Advanced technologies are said to be used as well. "In this war, the wealthiest and fiercest weapons companies were able to put their conventional arsenal into action as never before in history. All of these works prove how technology can be used to suppress and harm, and how innovation and effort can be wasted on working to do so. World literature gives a warning to readers that the impacts of innovations are highly dependent on how they are used.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The process of making an anthology comprising varying helped me expand my horizons of what media I consume. It wasn't always easy to find works that pertained to this specific topic. But because of that, the process of research and becoming more acquainted with what's out there was extremely valuable. I want to continue to explore global literature and see what else is out there that I might otherwise miss. For example, I plan on reading some of <a href="/anthology/spotlight.html">Liu Cixin's</a> works. Having a more expansive idea of an issue requires differing perspectives. My selection of world literature shows that the effects of technology can vary and often depend on how it is used.&nbsp;</p>

            <h1>Works included</h1>
            <p>There are a variety of media types included, including short fiction, films and poetry. They all come from non-western nations and represent often underheard perspectives. Of course this isn't a comprehensive view of all world liturature, but it gives some visions into the global canon relating to this issue.</p>
