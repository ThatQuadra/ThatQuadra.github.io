            <h1>Review of <em>Uncanny Valley</em>:</h1>
            <p><em>Uncanny Valley</em> is a 2015 Argentinian film directed by Federico Heller that contemplates themes of technology dependence and addiction. The film is quite short, less than ten minutes, but offers interesting ideas and commentary on our interactions with new forms of media and how that might affect other aspects of our lives.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The film takes place in a future society where immersive virtual reality is easily accessible. People are interviewed about their use and experiences with it. They live in dilapidated housing and talk about how the game is so much more exciting than real life. One person says that they haven’t left their home in years. Another reads off their kill to death ratio. They all say that it gives an escape from the, often “boring”, real world. A caretaker who looks after these people is also interviewed. They explain how they are concerned for the players’ health and their addiction to the game.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We then see the game. Its vibrant colors, loud sounds, and exciting gameplay. Monstrous enemies jump from nowhere and are promptly gunned down by the players. There’s a reason these people are so excited about it. When the people die in-game, they get thrown to the ground, this is jarring not just to the film's characters, the cut used gives the viewer the same shock. During a session, one of the players sees a glitch in the simulated world, and walks towards it, not heading the “out of bounds” warnings. This leads to a terrible discovery that changes their entire opinion of the game and their life as a whole.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><em>Uncanny Valley</em> largely deals with issues of technology dependence. All of the people interviewed are addicted to the game. This is probably meant to parallel and exaggerate the problems we see currently. I theorize that the film is specifically a response to the rapidly improving landscape of VR at the time. Around then was when virtual reality began to appear as a consumer technology. It’s a commentary on a “worst-case scenario” if people became dependent on it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The film also urges caution with technology in other ways. It very obviously shows how things that might seem benevolent could also have a more sinister motive. Again, around this time, new issues were arising. Social media was gaining popularity, and new concepts were being tried. There were concerns about data privacy in those applications and in general. I think the film is a response to this as well. Companies make products that although not marketed as such, have a darker side. In the real world, this might be data collection and sales, but in the film, there is something much more extreme.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Its use of CGI, something the studio, 3DAR, is known for, allows for more dynamic and unnatural imagery. The vibrancy of color and the otherworldly scenes in the game wouldn’t have been possible to produce through more traditional filmmaking methods. However, those methods are still very much utilized. Practical sets and camerawork were used to make especially the earlier documentary-esque scenes and also various others throughout the film. The contrast between the two types of shots is a large part of what makes the film so visually interesting. The division offers a comparison of the quiet, run-down real world and the exciting, dynamic, virtual one, echoing what the characters say.</p>
              <p>The documentary-style is another interesting aspect of <em>Uncanny Valley</em>. It, at first, is a way of introducing the world that it takes place in. Later, it serves as a contrast between the reality of the game, and the people oblivious to it. It allows it to have natural exposition, without anything being too forced. I think this worked well for the film and helped the story develop.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><em>Uncanny Valley</em> is highly recommended if you’re at all interested in technology and its impacts on society. It contains strong commentary on the state of the world. Even though it was made 6-7 years ago, it remains relevant, possibly more so. At only 8 minutes, it’s definitely worth a watch.</p>
